# Shared Module

Much of the code running on MacOS or NixOS is actually found here.

This configuration gets imported by both modules. Some configuration examples
include `git`, `zsh`, `vim`, and `tmux`.

## Layout

```text

├── config             # Config files not written in Nix
├── cachix             # Defines cachix, a global cache for builds
├── default.nix        # Defines how we import overlays
├── files.nix          # Non-Nix, static configuration files (now immutable!)
├── home-manager.nix   # The goods; most all shared config lives here
├── programs.nix       # List of programs configured via Home Manager
```
